# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction System

Customer churn is a major business challenge for subscription-based companies, directly impacting revenue and growth.  
This project focuses on **analyzing customer behavior, identifying churn drivers, and predicting churn risk** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning models, and an interactive Streamlit application**.

The project demonstrates my ability to build a **complete, end-to-end data science solution**, from raw data to business-ready insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a real-world inspired **telecom customer churn dataset** to:

- Explore customer behavior patterns
- Identify factors influencing churn
- Train and compare multiple ML classification models
- Build an **interactive analytics & prediction dashboard**
- Translate technical results into **actionable business insights**

The final output is a **production-style Streamlit application** that combines:
- Data exploration
- Model evaluation
- Real-time churn prediction
- Strategic recommendations

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand customer demographics, services, and billing behavior
- Analyze churn patterns using **EDA**
- Identify key churn-driving features
- Build and evaluate multiple ML models
- Predict churn risk for individual customers
- Provide insights that support **customer retention strategies**

---

## 📂 Dataset & Data Preparation

### 🔹 Dataset Details
The dataset includes customer-level information such as:
- Customer tenure
- Contract type
- Internet and service usage
- Billing and payment methods
- Monthly and total charges
- Churn label (Yes / No)

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric and handled missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**
- Ensured data was suitable for ML modeling and visualization

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed **comprehensive EDA** using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, integrated directly into the Streamlit app.

### EDA includes:
- **Univariate Analysis**
  - Distribution of numerical and categorical features
  - Customer composition and service usage patterns
- **Bivariate Analysis**
  - Feature vs churn comparisons
  - Numerical vs numerical trends
  - Categorical vs churn behavior

EDA helped uncover:
- High churn among month-to-month contract users
- Increased churn with higher monthly charges
- Strong influence of service-related features like Tech Support and Online Security

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Built and evaluated multiple classification models:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

### 🔹 Model Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- F1-score

The **Random Forest model** delivered the best balance between performance and stability, making it suitable for churn prediction use cases.

## 🖥️ Interactive Streamlit Application

The project is deployed as an **interactive Streamlit app** with three major sections:

### 📊 Data Exploration
- Interactive EDA with dynamic plots
- Feature-wise churn comparison
- Visual understanding of customer behavior

### 🤖 ML Prediction Engine
- Model selection (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Performance metrics displayed in real time
- Customer profile input form
- **Live churn risk prediction** with probability score

### 💡 Strategic Business Insights
- Key churn drivers summarized clearly
- Actionable retention strategies based on analysis
- Business-oriented recommendations for reducing churn

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Month-to-month contract customers show significantly higher churn
- Customers with high monthly charges and low tenure are at higher risk
- Lack of Tech Support and Online Security increases churn probability
- Payment method impacts retention behavior

These insights can help businesses design **targeted retention campaigns**.
